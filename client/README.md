## The portfolio of Seth Lyness - Full Stack Web Developer

## This react app features pages relating to my skills and career

### Home

A landing page where I encourage you to play with the UI as much as I do clicking through the call to action buttons to view my project gallery. Check out the desktop version's repositionable drag and drop navbar or play with the transitionable characters of the page's banner text.

### About  -- under construction

Fairly self-explanatory... A page telling a little about myself and my background in web development. Should you be the one in a million viewers to care to view this page in particular, I'm flattered. What can I say? Enjoy the art direction :)

### Skills  -- under construction

A interactive, yet to-the-point way of listing out which tools and skillsets I use regularly in my day to day life as a developer.
Quickly see if my skillset matches your team's needs.

### Project Gallery -- under construction

The meat and potatoes of the app. This page delivers videos of project walkthroughs from the projects I've worked on up until this point. While getting a visual, you have the option of linking to a live demo of the project as well as to that project's github repository.

### Contact -- under construction

Feel free to shoot me an email through this page if you have a project you'd like to talk about or a position on your development team you think you'd like me to fill. I'll be in touch!
